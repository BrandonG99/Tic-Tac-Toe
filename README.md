## How To Use

Take in turns clicking a square in which you'd like your symbol (O's or X's) to be placed on. The first player to get three of their symbol in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins! The app will state which symbol has won the round or whether it's a draw. To play another round, simply click on the 'NEW GAME' button below the game board and you're good to go!
